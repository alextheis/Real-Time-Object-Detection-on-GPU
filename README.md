# Real-Time-Object-Detection-on-GPU
Real-Time Object Detection on GPU Implemented YOLOv8 with PyTorch (CUDA) for real-time object detection. Optimized inference using batching and mixed precision, profiled with PyTorch Profiler, and benchmarked FPS/memory vs. baseline. Supports video streams and reproducible results.
